# devilutionX Dreamcast port

## How To Play:

- Build a CDI image using `Packaging/dreamcast/build.sh`.
- Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from your CD or GoG installation to `Packaging/dreamcast/cd_root/` before building (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)).
- `spawn.mpq` is optional for shareware mode.
- Use your own data files. Diablo MPQs are proprietary Blizzard assets.
- Boot the resulting CDI on hardware or in an emulator such as Flycast.
