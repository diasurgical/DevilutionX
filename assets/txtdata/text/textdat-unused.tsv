TEXT_GILLIAN11	Wait, before you say anything, my grandmother had a dream with giant, slithering creatures in it. She also saw Pepin running from a house in the town. Do you think this means anything?	true	Gillian5
TEXT_GILLIAN12	This is something that is far beyond anything I have ever learned. I can only think of one person in all of Tristram who could help you... Cain, of course.	true	Gillian7
TEXT_GILLIAN13	How could you even think of going back to that place? What could be so important?	true	Gillian9
TEXT_GILLIAN14	Those are the words of a drunkard. I don't see how they could be true.	true	Gillian14
TEXT_GILLIAN15	I heard that the priest Tremain was going to perform an exorcism, but I didn't go. I don't see why we all have to spend every moment captive to what is lurking underneath our town. I know that many have died at the hands of these monsters, but we need to try to go on. I know that you have come here to free Tristram from the clutches of darkness, and I hope that one day we can live in peace again.	true	Gillian15
TEXT_GILLIAN16	A treasure map? Do you have it with you? Let me see... Hmm, it looks like this is pretty old, and some of the buildings in the town are not on this map. Oh, I wish I could go and look for the treasure with you, but I have to start work soon.	true	Gillian17
TEXT_GILLIAN17	Beg pardon, but have you heard what has been happening? Some of the men have vanished from the village. Dica's sons, Inaius and Roof, claim to have seen strange lights(= blood stars) glowing deep within the woods a few days ago, but no one has heard from them since. I, too, have seen a crimson shimmering from beyond the ash groves, but I've been too afraid to approach it. I fear that Ogden or our healer Pepin may be next. Won't you please find out what has happened?	true	Gillian21
TEXT_GILLIAN18	Have you looked into what has caused the strange lights yet? There are more men missing since last we spoke, and I'm beginning to fear that soon we may all vanish.	true	Gillian22
TEXT_GILLIAN19	Demons that assume the form of beautiful women, you say? That's horrible! Thank the Light that you solved this mystery before any more of our men were lured to their deaths. Thank you for keeping us safe from the powers of darkness once again.	true	Gillian23
TEXT_GILLIAN20	Pray your pardon, but I've something to tell you that you may find interesting. It was the strangest thing. While drinking at the tavern, Farnham was rambling about something called Azurewrath. He also said something about a fallen angel. It was hard to understand him because he was very drunk and disoriented, but I seem to remember something about a key in a barrel. He also kept covering his face and repeating the word 'Izual' over and over again.	true	Gillian24
TEXT_GILLIAN21	You know, now that I think about it... maybe it wasn't a key in a barrel, but a barrel that was the key. Does that make any more sense?	true	Gillian25
TEXT_GILLIAN22	Azurewrath and Izual. I don't know why I didn't remember that story earlier. I've heard it often enough from my grandmother and Cain the Storyteller. Well, I hope that my information was still more of a help than a hindrance. May Light guide you, my friend.	true	Gillian26
TEXT_GILLIAN23	I know that my grandmother’s story seems strange, but the graveyard does have many mysteries surrounding it. It couldn’t hurt you to put something there and see what happens, could it? Maybe you will find out something that will help us all.	true	Gillian28
TEXT_GILLIAN24	My grandmother had a dream about you last night, she said that in her dream you used your bare hands to defeat one of those foul monsters that lurk under the church. When it died, it exploded into fabulous treasure! Although she was a bit frightened by her dream, she was able to describe the beast quite clearly to me.	true	Gillian29
TEXT_GILLIAN25	My grandmother had that exact same dream again. She said you are quite brave and seemed very pleased with your prize.	true	Gillian30
TEXT_GILLIAN26	I really don't know much about the priest Tremain. He never visits the tavern, preferring to keep to the company of Pepin and Cain. Perhaps it is because they, too, have more scholarly pursuits.	true	Gillian38
TEXT_PEPIN12	Roof and Inaius are missing? Light protect us! Is there no place that is safe? Our only hope of returning to a peaceful life rests in you. Please, you must find those boys and bring them home to their family.	true	Pepin4
TEXT_PEPIN13	Horazon was insane. There are forces with which one does not interfere. It would not surprise me if you found only the charred remains of this damned fool.	true	Pepin6
TEXT_PEPIN14	Farnham is often confused, but he speaks a powerful name when the word Izual passes his lips. Cain would be able to tell you in much greater detail the legend of this warrior.	true	Pepin7
TEXT_PEPIN15	I suppose it isn't beyond the realm of possibility if you could bear being in that room again. Your description of the atrocities committed there would be enough to keep me far from it.	true	Pepin9
TEXT_PEPIN16	For once I can vouch for Farnham's extraordinary claim. There are many mentions in the books that I have been reading about a place of great healing where warriors of light would go to mend the wounds sustained in the Sin War. If you could find this place it would most assuredly be to the benefit of us all.	true	Pepin14
TEXT_PEPIN17	I was asked to assist in the exorcism. My skills were able to ease the poor man's suffering as Tremain drove the demon from his body. While I was treating him for an exceptionally high fever, he spoke of a place of searing heat. The tortured fellow cried out about Hell and falling into a pit of flame. I could not make any sense of it, and thankfully he soon recovered.	true	Pepin15
TEXT_PEPIN18	Good hero, a moment of your time please. While attending one of the townsfolk who had taken quite ill, I noticed something odd about his home. There were strange sounds and a sickly sweet smell rising from the cellar. Thinking perhaps these fumes had something to do with his sickness. In his cellar were monstrous worms shifting and squirming up from the underground. I beg of you, slay these creatures before they can make their way into the town. I left the door to his house open for you. It is the one opposite of mine.	true	Pepin23
TEXT_PEPIN19	I fear that the worms could soon overrun the village. I know that they are coming up from under the house that is opposite mine. Just the thought of those slimy beasts oozing into my house makes me want to be ill. Please, rid us of them.	true	Pepin24
TEXT_PEPIN20	Once again you have saved this humble town from the encroaching evil. We are, as always, forever in your debt.	true	Pepin25
TEXT_PEPIN21	My friend, I must speak with you. While going to help a sick villager I came upon a demon in the town. I fled from the house and accidentally left the door open in my haste. I pray that the vial creature is still in there. Please help us before it comes for us all.	true	Pepin28
TEXT_PEPIN22	These creatures must be banished from our town. To my shame I left the door open, but that should make all the easier for you to find the house.	true	Pepin29
TEXT_PEPIN23	Once again the town is in your debt. It is only your strength and force of will that can leads us out of this evil time.	true	Pepin30
TEXT_PEPIN24	Once again I require your strong arm and quick quirks to aid the people of this town. I am in need of certain reagents to help fight the plagues that the demons have unleashed on the land by their very presence. If you could gather these few items, it will save many lives!	true	Pepin31
TEXT_PEPIN25	The diseases spread quickly and many are dying. Please, help me by finding the reagents so that I can use it to make an antidote.	true	Pepin32
TEXT_PEPIN26	Thank you so much! You bring hope and light to this dark and troubled times. I wish for you to have this in the hopes that will aid you in your battle against the darkness.	true	Pepin33
TEXT_PEPIN27	I know that I ask much of you, but I must now ask that you find a pool of clear water. Take these containers, fill them and return them me as soon as you can. With the clear water I can create an elixir of wondrous power that will benefit us all.	true	Pepin34
TEXT_PEPIN28	Have you brought what I need? The clear water will allow me to create a very power elixir, fill the containers that I gave you and return with them.	true	Pepin35
TEXT_PEPIN29	Very good, my friend! Very good! Just give a minute to mix these ingredients... Perfect! Here is some of the elixir as promised.	true	Pepin36
TEXT_PEPIN30	His Holiness is a wondrous man of great knowledge and understanding. He has shown me many cures for rare and deadly diseases. He brings me books and reagents for my work whenever he can. But I fear that he may some day take on a task that is too great even for him.	true	Pepin44
TEXT_GRISWOLD14	I've seen no such things in my shop, but I will keep a close watch for them. Perhaps if they come this way, they won't take kindly to the fires of my forge.	true	Griswold5
TEXT_GRISWOLD15	I admit that I too have seen these strange lights, but I have not felt pulled towards them. I'll be sure to steer clear of them and will tell everyone that visits here to do likewise.	true	Griswold6
TEXT_GRISWOLD16	A bold tale indeed! My limited time beneath the cathedral leaves me poorly equipped to offer you any help with this. But, as always, you'll find Cain well versed in legends and folklore.	true	Griswold8
TEXT_GRISWOLD17	The blade Azurewrath... It's legend! It was cast by the angelic weaponsmith Cinadide and tempered within the fires of judgment! Whoever wields this weapon will find the legions of Hell at his feet! If you found this blade, I would begin to truly believe that you could end the nightmare that has befallen our town.	true	Griswold9
TEXT_GRISWOLD18	When I found Wirt, he was very near a room that sounds like the vile pit you've described. The stench of death was heavy in the air and, consumed as I was with getting the lad to safety, I did not go further than I had to. If he claims to know something of that place, I would not discount his word easily.	true	Griswold11
TEXT_GRISWOLD19	Farnham speaks of a place that exists, at least in legend. Warriors would go to a place at the edge of Hell to gird themselves for battle against the armies of darkness. If the stories are true, untold treasures could lie upon this island of the sunless sea.	true	Griswold15
TEXT_GRISWOLD20	Ah, you speak of an ancient and evil weapon. Tread lightly in this area, for the legends of Shadowfang are as black as a moonless winter night. Crafted within the Hellforge, Shadowfang can rend the very soul from whoever it strikes. I do not envy you if is in your mind to defeat the one who wields it. May light protect you, brave hero.	true	Griswold16
TEXT_GRISWOLD21	I'm in luck! A caravan has stopped just outside of the village and is taking supplies to the lands of the East. Certain items will bring a special price... if you can get them for me.	true	Griswold27

TEXT_GRISWOLD27	I'm working on a method for strengthening armor. Unfortunately, I don't have what I need just now. If you could possibly bring me what I require, the first one is yours!	true	Griswold33
TEXT_GRISWOLD28	I still think I can strengthen the right armor. You know what you need to bring me.	true	Griswold34
TEXT_GRISWOLD29	Good find! See if this works any better for you.	true	Griswold35
TEXT_GRISWOLD30	If you come across any enchanted equipment, I could try to learn how it was crafted and then use those methods for my own creations. I should probably start with something easy.	true	Griswold36

TEXT_GRISWOLD32	Thank you, oh great and mighty customer... err... uhh... champion! This will take some study... Done!	true	Griswold38
TEXT_GRISWOLD33	Keep your eyes open for a figurine made of iron. I have uncovered some old records concerning a specific type of figurine and the secrets of metalcrafting that it holds.	true	Griswold39

TEXT_GRISWOLD36	If you deliver to me the right item so I can combine it with this metal, I could craft something worthy of the warriors of Heaven!	true	Griswold42
TEXT_GRISWOLD37	Your efforts are not in vain. It seems that all is as I had hoped. I trust you will find this useful in your battles below?	true	Griswold43
	Haha, they have you hunting worms now? What's next? Leaf collecting? Picking up mushrooms? Look, friend, you have a whole church full of demons over there to worry about. I don't see how a few little worms could be so bad.	true	Wirt5
	You know, I've been looking for those lights, but I can't find them. If Gillian says they're there, I believe her, but I have yet to see them for myself.	true	Wirt6
	The care and feeding of demons is definitely not an interest of mine. Here is a piece of friendly advice - if you get the chance, kill anything you see down there.	true	Wirt8
	If you were to find any trace of Izual or the blade Azurewrath, even I would be impressed. That is definitely one of a kind.	true	Wirt9
	This is one time that you should listen to Farnham. I have heard of this place, and I know a few sorcerers who have tried to create a portal to get there.	true	Wirt15
	I don't know who this Fleshdoom is, but I have heard rumors of an ebon blade that cleaves a soul from the body. Even I would not try to sell that thing, no matter what the profit. If you find it, you should do as Tremain says and destroy it as quickly as possible.	true	Wirt16

	Rock? Tree? Bridge? I have no idea what you're talking about.	true	Wirt24
	Look, I know my prices are high, but one of my contacts had an... accident, and I need some help refilling my more mundane inventory. I'll trade you a quality item if you can just complete this little list for me.	true	Wirt25
	Listen, I'll make it worth your time if you will get me what I asked you for. Besides, you know you want to find out what I'm going to give you in return.	true	Wirt26
	Thanks! This should hold me over until I can find a new errand boy. Too bad you're so busy. Oh yeah, here's your part of the bargain.	true	Wirt27
	Pssst... over here... I have something very special for sale today! I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I can just tell that it's great. I'm gonna offer you a bargain - a thousand gold takes it. Right now, no questions, and no returns!	true	Wirt28
	Hey, you! Yeah, I'm talking to you! I... acquired this strange book. I know it must do something big, but you need a crystal eyepiece to read it, so it's useless to me. However, I would be willing to trade you this rare and mystical tome, uh, for just a few things.	true	Wirt29
	Look, this very special book that I have can be yours for so little. Don't tell anyone what a great deal I'm giving you or it would ruin my reputation.	true	Wirt30
	Amazing, you actually found everything I wanted! Well, here's the book, but you're going to have to find a crystal eyepiece to read it. Good luck!	true	Wirt31
	Yeah, Tremain! He gets around, doesn't he? Or haven't you heard? My friends in some of the other towns say that he passes through, picking up a few books here, a pinch of bat claw there. Never seems to have the problems most do getting in and out of Tristram, that's for sure.	true	Wirt41
	All I can do now is pray for us all.	true	Tremain0
	I seek a champion to undertake a serious duty, and the people of this town speak well of your courage and skill. The Archbishop Lazarus, once King Leoric's most trusted advisor and a member of our order, has taken the path of evil. Not long ago, Lazarus led a party of simple townsfolk into the labyrinth to find the king's missing son, Albrecht. Only a few of them escaped with their lives. Curse me for a fool! I should have suspected his veiled treachery then! For I have learned that it was Lazarus himself who kidnapped Leoric's son and has since hidden him within the labyrinth. I still don't understand why the Archbishop has turned to the darkness, or what his interest is in Albrecht. Unless... he means to sacrifice him at the full moon. That must be what he has planned! The survivors of his rescue party say that Lazarus was last seen in the deepest bowels of the labyrinth, some sixteen levels beneath the Cathedral. You must hurry, and save the prince from the sacrificial blade of this demented fiend!	true	Tremain1
	Why do you delay?! Time is of the essence! The prince and the people of this kingdom are counting on you!	true	Tremain2
	So, Lazarus has paid the price for his betrayal and justice is served! For your services this day, I bestow this mace unto you. Its name is Lightforge, and it is the holiest of our order's artifacts. As I am the last of this order, I entrust it to you. May the Light guide you.	true	Tremain3
	This is terrible! Lazarus will surely burn in Hell for his horrific deed! Although the boy that you describe may not be our prince, I believe that Albrecht may yet be in danger. Whatever vile power lies beneath the ground, has assuredly secured its foothold in our world. All I can do now is pray for us all.	true	Tremain4
	I have had a most disturbing experience that I must share with you, my friend. Earlier today, I was called upon to help one of the men that escaped from the labyrinth. He was deranged, violent, and kept lashing out at all of those who tried to calm him. I suspected that he was possessed by some sort of demonic entity, and so began to drive the evil from within him. After many hours, I was able to exorcise a demon who called himself Fleshdoom, but the hellion fled into the labyrinth. You may think that I am mad, but after speaking with the man and battling with Fleshdoom, I believe that the labyrinth has somehow become a gateway to the underworld. As you descend deeper, you may find yourself upon the doorstep of Hell itself. Finally, the man who was possessed retained memories of an ancient demonblade named Shadowfang. If you find the demon Fleshdoom, beware this foul sword. While I fear the dangers below grow even greater, you must find Fleshdoom and slay him. Bring the sword to me and I can destroy it, but do not wield it. For its power can corrupt, absolutely.	true	Tremain5
	Fleshdoom's demise is a great good to the world, yet Shadowfang remains! It must be found and destroyed! Do not attempt to use the demonblade, champion. It will corrupt and madden any mortal who wields it. I alone can end its dark evil.	true	Tremain6
	Light be praised! You found the cursed demonblade! Only its destruction can ensure the safety of us all! Wait... what treachery is this?! Ow, it burns! Hellfire, consuming me! You must take this, to the Hellforge and cast it in before-NOOOOOOO!	true	Tremain7
	The evil that you move against is the Dark Lord of Terror, known to mortal man as... Diablo. It was he who was imprisoned within the labyrinth many centuries ago. Find Diablo... or we may never have a chance to rid the world of his evil again!	true	Cain0
	Yes, you speak of Lazarus, one who was once well-respected in our land. Even before King Leoric descended into madness and lost his son, the Archishop Lazarus was acting... strangely. Lazarus seemed to be motivated by unseen forces, clinging to shadows, and acting out some dark plan that was not his own.	true	Cain3
	Worms that rise up from the ground? Many of the ancient writings speak of poisonous insects, and foul creatures of the skies and seas, plaguing mankind. It is no surprise that the very earth would offer up a similar peril, now that the denizens of the underworld are upon us.	true	Cain5
	While the barmaid may seem a bit confused at times, it is true that men have been disappearing from the village. It reminds me of ancient writings about a demonic temptress called Andariel. Known as the Maiden of Anguish, her thirst for mortal blood was so great, that she sought to learn a spell to breach the mortal realm. By seducing one of the dark sorcerers of the netherworld, Andariel took the knowledge she needed and so began to lure mortal men into her dark corner of Hell. If these legends are true, she's not a creature to be taken lightly.	true	Cain6
	So, you seek knowledge concerning the wars of Hell, do you? Cryptic tomes speak of great battles that determined which of the demonic lords are to rule over Hell. They also mention a bitter rivalry between two of these lords - Azmodan, who led the Horned Death against the armies of Light, and Belial, known as the Lord of Lies. Their hatred of each other is eternal - the reasons for their loathing, lost even to themselves. Tales abound, that the mad wizard Horazon somehow trapped the lieutenants of these two Lords of Hell within his sanctum. There can be no more dangerous a path to tread, than the one that falls alongside of demons. Should you also seek this path, watch your life, and your soul - very carefully - my friend.	true	Cain8
	Farnham has taken to drinking quite heavily since his encounters in the labyrinth. But within the ramblings of this drunken man, rests a legend well steeped in myth and mystery. Sit for a moment, my friend, and let me tell you of Izual and Azurewrath. The saga of Izual takes place during the lost battles in Hell. Izual was an angel who was given charge of the holy ruin blade, Azurewrath. Leading a daring assault on the Hellforge, Izual was set upon by hundreds of blackened demons, and was fatally wounded! The fiends cast the dying angel into a dark pit, where the powers of chaos transformed him, as he drowned in a whirlpool of burning blood! Evil possessed Izual! The feathers of his wings burned away to reveal leathery skin, and horns ripped through the flesh of his head! When he finally arose from that black pit, Izual was an angel no more! Transformed into a creature of evil, he was once again given charge of Azurewrath, assuring that the blade would never again be used against the denizens of Hell!	true	Cain9
	You must've been speaking with Wirt! His is a sad story indeed. That poor child was taken into the labyrinth by the demons, ripped from the very arms of his mother, Canace. May her soul rest in peace. The boy managed to escape, but only after they had chewed off his leg, and he has not been quite sane since. He often speaks in riddles, but his knowledge of the labyrinth... may hold some truth.	true	Cain11
	Hmm, an island, where angels watched? Although Farnham's memory is often cloudy these days, that does seem familiar. Perhaps the ancient chronicles of the Sin War can help us... Ah, yes, here is something. In a time long-forgotten, a sea of blue rested on the edge of the fiery netherworld. This was an oasis for those who acted as the watchmen over the gates of Hell. Angels and warriors of Light could use this place to heal themselves, and gather their strength. It was also a staging area where they could train and prepare for the Sin War. Legends speak of a trinity of rocks that hide the path to this island of the sunless sea.	true	Cain16
	The priest Tremain is a holy man from an ancient order. Their dealings with the evil forces at work are well respected, and well documented. I, too, have heard legends that speak of the cursed demonblade called Shadowfang. It is said to consume the tortured souls of its victims. These souls are trapped within its ebon blade and augment its unholy power. I have also read of a great Hellforge, where even the mightiest weapon could be created... or destroyed. Tread carefully when dealing with Shadowfang and its master, lest you be drawn into the sword as well!	true	Cain17
	That sounds quite disgusting, and I'm afraid that I haven't heard anything about any worms. Perhaps Cain the Storyteller could be of some help.	true	Ogden3
	Gillian has been going on and on about strange lights in the trees, but I haven't been able to make heads nor tails of her story. I certainly haven't seen any strange lights, and if I did, they would be the least of my worries.	true	Ogden4
	These sound like dark creatures indeed. I am ignorant to matters of this nature, but I would assume that our storyteller may know of such legends.	true	Ogden6
	There is an old story of an angel named Izual, but I don't remember much more than that.	true	Ogden7
	Wirt is talking backwards again? I hate it when he does that! I don't have time to help you decipher his riddle, but I will tell you one thing - don't get involved with that rapscallion.	true	Ogden9
	You know, sometimes I wonder how much faith you can put into what Farnham says. He spends so much time reliving his memories of the labyrinth and just being plain drunk, that he doesn't always make much sense. I guess you could ask around, though.	true	Ogden14
	I saw the exorcism! It was incredible how Tremain drove the evil spirit from that man's racked and tortured body! I pray that something that horrific never happens to anyone here ever again.	true	Ogden15
	Your brave tales of fighting demons have reminded me of something, good master. A traveller passed through here some time ago. He was quite proud of a very unique weapon he held, and while becoming quite drunk, boasted of its power. I never saw him again, and I suspect that he ventured too close to the Cathedral.	true	Ogden26
	Have you ever seen that traveller I told you about? The one with the enchanted weapon? Well, I suppose that he left our village as so many others have, or he must be dead.	true	Ogden27
	Yes, that is certainly the weapon that he wore. You know, I've been thinking about something else that traveller said. He inferred that the true powers of the weapon would be unleashed only when it tasted the blood of a very specific kind of creature.	true	Ogden28
	Were the stories the traveller told us true? Oh, I see you don't know yet. Well, I clearly recall that he said by slaying a certain monster, the weapon you found would become something quite special.	true	Ogden29
	While I understand that your purpose may be of a higher calling, surely some well-earned gold would be welcomed. Some townspeople from a nearby village have offered a reward for the destruction of a creature that razed their homes and property. They demand positive proof that the creature has been slain, and I can only think of one way to do that.	true	Ogden30
	You can say whatever you want, but without proof I cannot give you the reward.	true	Ogden31
	Oh, disgusting! But certainly proof enough for anyone. Here's your reward as promised.	true	Ogden32
	Good master, a moment of your time, please? My tavern was broken into during the night. No one was hurt but many items were stolen, including a chest belonging to a mysterious wanderer who once stayed here. I found the body of a thief near the Cathedral with telltale wounds from one of the creatures below mocking his broken body. Some of the stolen goods were near the body, but the chest, and the key to open it, were nowhere in sight. If you should find those keys while on your brave crusade, you should recover them. Then, if you find the chest, you can open it and see what secrets it contains. Perhaps it will be something that can help you on your quests.	true	Ogden33
	Remember, good master, the chest is locked and is useless without the key. If you do find the chest and get the key, you should see what's inside. I don't expect the owner back here again.	true	Ogden34
	I see that you have found the key - now you just need to find the chest that it belongs to.	true	Ogden35
	Seek out the domicile to which Pepin the Healer has directed you. It is there that your missions will become clear, and your methods evident.	true	Adria5
	The succubus is a demon that feasts upon the essence of mortal men. You will find that Andariel has quite an appetite. The town will soon be devoid of any adult males, unless you stop her feeding now.	true	Adria6
	You must destroy the two demons that Horazon has trapped within his sanctum at all costs! Should they escape from their imprisonment, they will create a link to this world that will make what lies below the Cathedral seem like a children's tale.	true	Adria8
	The lair of the Butcher is steeped in demonic power, and casting any spell or passage there could cause unexpected results.	true	Adria11
	This legendary place is real and great rewards await you should you find it. Nothing more can I say.	true	Adria16
	You must be ever watchful, for Fleshdoom is an enemy who is both cruel and quick. His ebon blade is composed of the essence of evil. If you can destroy both of them, it would do much to weaken his dark master.	true	Adria17
	Hello, good friend, I have been working on a means to increase the strength of my potions. I believe that I could brew better potions if you could just find me the correct reagents.	true	Adria27
	Remember, with the correct reagents, my potions are more powerful.	true	Adria28
	Excellent! Just a pinch should do it... Ahh, here is a sample.	true	Adria29
	It seems that there are many uses for the scrolls which are found beneath the church. I should be able to scribe a book of magic if I had enough of the proper scrolls to study.	true	Adria30
	Remember, with enough scrolls, I can create a book of magic for you.	true	Adria31
	Yes, I can see that when I combine these scrolls just so... I will teach what I have learned so that you may also know more secrets of this magic.	true	Adria32
	I have a quest for you if you are brave enough to accept it. Great power can be found in some of the devices that may be hidden below the church. With the right ones, I could work wonders!	true	Adria33
	Remember, the right device in my hands can become quite powerful.	true	Adria34
	This is amazing! The mystic energies in this crystal are powerful, but unfocused. If you could find for me a specific staff to channel its power through...	true	Adria35
	The crystal holds a magic that is strong, but you need to find the correct staff with which to focus its energy!	true	Adria36
	Hand me that staff and stand back! Vita te chlorum an duriam! Ahhhh, it is complete.	true	Adria37
	Faith is absolute belief in the unseen. The priest Tremain is from a holy order long asleep in this land. He keeps a promise and a charge issued ages ago and sustains a union with realms that even my vision cannot reach. He knows much, but not as much as he believes.	true	Adria48
