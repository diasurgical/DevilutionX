1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,520
The Soulstone burns with hellfire as an eerie

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,240
red glow blurs your vision

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,560
Fresh blood flows into your eyes and you

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,840
begin to hear the tormented whispers of the damned

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,440
You have done what you knew must be done

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,460
The essence of Diablo is contained

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,860
For now...

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,240
You pray that you have become strong enough

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,820
to contain the demon and keep him at bay

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,260
Although you have been fortified by your quest,

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,439
you can still feel him, clawing his way

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,980
up from the dark recesses of your soul

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,040
Fighting to retain control, your thoughts turn toward

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,760
the ancient, mystic lands of the Far East

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,100
Perhaps there, beyond the desolate wastes of Aranak,

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,560
you will find an answer

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,340
Or perhaps, salvation
